# arduino-traffic-light-system
Basic Arduino project using LEDs to simulate traffic signals using tinkercad.

**Description 
This project simulate the traffic light system using arduino and LEDs with the help of tinkercad plateform.
It follows standard Red, Green and Yellow light timing.

**components Used
-ARDUINO UNO
-LEDs
-Breadboard
-220ohm resistors 
-Jumper wires

**Working
The Arduino controls LEDs in a sequence
-RED ON--STOP
-GREEN ON--READY
-YELLOW ON--GO
with the time delay of 5 seconds

**CODE
The Arduino code is written in Embedded C using Arduino IDE.
